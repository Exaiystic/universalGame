 What we are doing within these first few lines of code is setting up the document.
 The first thing that we are doing is stating the type of document that this file is,
 which is html, therefore, we state that the document type is html.

 Whilst opening the html tag, which is needed at the start of every html file, as well as to be
 closed at the end of every html file, we might as well set the language of the document,
 therefore the user's web browser will not have to automatically detect the language - as a web
 browser's function may not be accurate.

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">

 The next set of lines are embedded within the head tag. The head tag is used for storing 'metadata', 
 which means data about data. In this case, I use the head tag as a container for storing external 
 css styling which I will be using throughout this web page, as well as adding two meta tags which are 
 needed for bootstrap to work - a third party framework which is also used throughout this document.
 
 I have also added my own style sheet, which can help keep my military theme consistent accross 
 multiple web pages. Lastly, the title has been set to 'Sign Up | Military Clicker', which will be 
 displayed on the tab of the page.

The script, that is entered below, is used in order to store client-side processes and actions - known as 
JavaScript. When a function is called, the web browser will be looking within the script tag for a 
function with a matching name in order to execute it.

The function called 'togglePasswordAssign' is a function that when called, will either show/hide the user's 
input password - depending on if the password was already showing. This is done through a conditional 
statement saying that if the password was showing, it should be hidden (by changing the field type from 
text to password) and if the password was not showing, the password would be shown (by changing the type 
from password to plain text).

Function 'signupProcess' notifies the user that he/she has successfully signed up or not. This is done by 
getting the values of all of the form, and then analysing whether or not they are all at least one 
character long - if even one of them is blank (less than one character long), then the browser will tell 
the user that they need to fill in all of the fields. However, if they are at least one character long, 
then the browser will tell the user that they have been signed up.

 Everything within the body tag of the html document is part of the main section. The first few lines 
 that are within the body tag however are lines that import scripts from external libraries, such as

 The navigation bar for the webpage. The navbar was made using the bootstrap 4 framework; bootstrap 4 is 
 a framework of CSS styled elements that have been given their own classes. 
 This allows for bootstrap users to call already-styled elements simply by stating an element class. 
		 
 The navbar itself is present on every webpage and can scale based on the browser resolution. 
 The navigation bar is a container for links that, when clicked on, take the user to another web page, 
 based on which link they have clicked on.

 The following segment is the main portion of the web page - it is where the main text of this page will 
 be. The text is styled by having it wrapped inside of a div with an appropriate id of 'wrapper'. With 
 the main content within this div, I can style the main content by simply styling the div, instead of 
 having to style every independent elements. Of course, in some places, it is simply better to style 
 independent elements.
 
 The first few lines set up both the wrapper div, as well as a div called 'container', which will act 
 as a place for storing elements that can be manipulated with bootstrap - which is most of these elements.
 
 The next lines create a header that will be at the top of the wrapper. The header tag has been given an 
 id so that the content can be externally styled to be made bold, as well as give the tag a different 
 background colour. The header tag is then closed so that no other element is unintentionally given the 
 same styling as the header itself.
 
 After the header is the section tag housing an article tag. The section tag makes the main content that 
 will be within the div wrapper, whereas the article tag acts like a paragraph - a set of content that 
 is just part of the main page. The section tag has been given an id of 'mainSection' in order to indicate 
 that everything within this tag will be part of the main section. The id itself has styling attached to 
 it that basically helps space out the content around it, in order to make the web page look less 
 cluttered. Additionally, the article section has styling attached to it which makes the set content 
 within the tag look as if it was inside of a box - this was styled by giving the element a border, and a 
 different shade of green for a background.
 
 Each article is given it's own header (and consistently styled) in order to act as a subtitle. Of course, 
 the article also includes one or two paragraphs worth of content before the article tag is closed, and 
 another one is opened for more content.
 
 The article tag also house the form which contains the entry field for both the user's user name and 
 password. Additionally, there is a button that is embedded within the password entry field that calls the 
 togglePassword function from the script tag at the top of the file. At the bottom of the form is a submit 
 button which will call the loginNotify function when it is clicked. 
 
 At the end of the section tag, there is a check box which the user will tick if he/she accept the terms 
 and conditions. Furthermore, before the end of the div, there is a footer. Despite the footer being 
 empty, it is kept there so that the space management of the div does not become misaligned.
 
 Within the section tag, there is a form tag. A form tag is used to assign elements within the tag to a 
 form, which can submit data to a server, if connected and set up properly. The form contains fields which 
 the user have to fill in regarding their username, password, email, first name and surname.
 
 At the end of the form, the user has to click a submit button, which will trigger the signupProcess 
 function.
