 What we are doing within these first few lines of code is setting up the document.
 The first thing that we are doing is stating the type of document that this file is,
 which is html, therefore, we state that the document type is html.

 Whilst opening the html tag, which is needed at the start of every html file, as well as to be
 closed at the end of every html file, we might as well set the language of the document,
 therefore the user's web browser will not have to automatically detect the language - as a web
 browser's function may not be accurate.

<!doctype html>
<html lang="en">

 The next set of lines are embedded within the head tag. The head tag is used for storing 'metadata', 
 which means data about data. In this case, I use the head tag as a container for storing external 
 css styling which I will be using throughout this web page, as well as adding two meta tags which are 
 needed for bootstrap to work - a third party framework which is also used throughout this document.
 
 I have also added my own style sheet, which can help keep my military theme consistent accross 
 multiple web pages. Lastly, the title has been set to 'Welcome to Military Clicker', which will be 
 displayed on the tab of the page.

 Everything within the body tag of the html document is part of the main section. The first few lines 
 that are within the body tag however are lines that import scripts from external libraries, such as 
 jQuery, Popper.js and Bootstrap.js.

 The navigation bar for the webpage. The navbar was made using the bootstrap 4 framework; bootstrap 4 is 
 a framework of CSS styled elements that have been given their own classes. 
 This allows for bootstrap users to call already-styled elements simply by stating an element class. 
		 
 The navbar itself is present on every webpage and can scale based on the browser resolution. 
 The navigation bar is a container for links that, when clicked on, take the user to another web page, 
 based on which link they have clicked on.

 The following segment is the main portion of the web page - it is where the main text of this page will 
 be. The text is styled by having it wrapped inside of a div with an appropriate id of 'wrapper'. With 
 the main content within this div, I can style the main content by simply styling the div, instead of 
 having to style every independent elements. Of course, in some places, it is simply better to style 
 independent elements.

						Military Clicker is a spin-off version of the popular game "Cookie Clicker",

						games within the idle genre, however, this game has a twist of that you are 
						getting a bigger army with each click.
					</p><p class="col-">
						The aim of the game is to build the biggest army known to mankind. You can 
						achieve this by training more and more soldiers, invading countries and 
						buying better equipment for your soldiers to train with. If you would like

						By playing this game, you agree to play fairly without cheating. This can include 
						hacking the amount of soldiers you have, speeding up the game's time, and other 3rd 
						party methods of cheating.<br> You are also to not abuse exploits and bugs that are 
						within the current iteration of the game in order to progress and/or gain an advantage.<br>
						The game was made by Thomas Broughton only; all aspects of the game, apart from the 
						background, was made by Thomas Broughton. The camouflage background was taken from google 
						images, with the specific source being watermarked on the background itself. The current 
						soldier sprite is temporary art made by an unknown artist, which is soon to be replaced 
						by art under Thomas Broughton. Until all resources are made by the original devs of the 
						game, Military Clicker will not be monetised.<br> Should the game be publicly mentioned, 
						it is not needed to disclose who the creator of the game is, but in the case that the game 
						is publicly credited, all credits should go to Thomas Broughton and nobody else.
