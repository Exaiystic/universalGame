 What we are doing within these first few lines of code is setting up the document.
 The first thing that we are doing is stating the type of document that this file is,
 which is html, therefore, we state that the document type is html.

 Whilst opening the html tag, which is needed at the start of every html file, as well as to be
 closed at the end of every html file, we might as well set the language of the document,
 therefore the user's web browser will not have to automatically detect the language - as a web
 browser's function may not be accurate.

<!doctype html>
<html lang="en">

 The next set of lines are embedded within the head tag. The head tag is used for storing 'metadata', 
 which means data about data. In this case, I use the head tag as a container for storing external 
 css styling which I will be using throughout this web page, as well as adding two meta tags which are 
 needed for bootstrap to work - a third party framework which is also used throughout this document.
 
 I have also added my own style sheet, which can help keep my military theme consistent accross 
 multiple web pages. Lastly, the title has been set to 'Welcome to Military Clicker', which will be 
 displayed on the tab of the page.

 that are within the body tag however are lines that import scripts from external libraries, such as

 The navigation bar for the webpage. The navbar was made using the bootstrap 4 framework; bootstrap 4 is 
 a framework of CSS styled elements that have been given their own classes. 
 This allows for bootstrap users to call already-styled elements simply by stating an element class. 
		 
 The navbar itself is present on every webpage and can scale based on the browser resolution. 
 The navigation bar is a container for links that, when clicked on, take the user to another web page, 
 based on which link they have clicked on.

 The following segment is the main portion of the web page - it is where the main text of this page will 
 be. The text is styled by having it wrapped inside of a div with an appropriate id of 'wrapper'. With 
 the main content within this div, I can style the main content by simply styling the div, instead of 
 having to style every independent elements. Of course, in some places, it is simply better to style 
 independent elements.
 
 The first few lines set up both the wrapper div, as well as a div called 'container', which will act 
 as a place for storing elements that can be manipulated with bootstrap - which is most of these elements.
 
 The 'col-' tag which is seen in lots of the elements placed inside of the container is there so that the 
 web browser will scale elements downward in size correctly when the window resolution shrinks. This can 
 make the web page look different on different resolutions, but will make the content easier to read on 
 smaller window sizes.
 
 The next lines create a header that will be at the top of the wrapper. The header tag has been given an 
 id so that the content can be externally styled to be made bold, as well as give the tag a different 
 background colour. The header tag is then closed so that no other element is unintentionally given the 
 same styling as the header itself.
 
 After the header is the section tag housing an article tag. The section tag make the main content that 
 will be within the div wrapper, whereas the article tag acts like a paragraph - a set of content that 
 is just part of the main page. The section tag has been given an id of 'mainSection' in order to indicate 
 that everything within this tag will be part of the main section. The id itself has styling attached to 
 it that basically helps space out the content around it, in order to make the web page look less 
 cluttered. Additionally, the article section has styling attached to it which makes the set content 
 within the tag look as if it was inside of a box - this was styled by giving the element a border, and a 
 different shade of green for a background.
 
 Each article is given it's own header (and consistently styled) in order to act as a subtitle. Of course, 
 the article also includes one or two paragraphs worth of content before the article tag is closed, and 
 another one is opened for more content.
 
 At the end of the section tag, there is a check box which the user will tick if he/she accept the terms 
 and conditions. Furthermore, before the end of the div, there is a footer. Despite the footer being 
 empty, it is kept there so that the space management of the div does not become misaligned.

						By playing this game, you agree to play fairly without cheating. This can include

						party methods of cheating.<br> You are also to not abuse exploits and bugs that are 
						within the current iteration of the game in order to progress and/or gain an advantage.<br>
						The game was made by Thomas Broughton only; all aspects of the game, apart from the 
						background, was made by Thomas Broughton. The camouflage background was taken from google 
						images, with the specific source being watermarked on the background itself. The current 
						soldier sprite is temporary art made by an unknown artist, which is soon to be replaced 
						by art under Thomas Broughton. Until all resources are made by the original devs of the 
						game, Military Clicker will not be monetised.<br> Should the game be publicly mentioned, 
						it is not needed to disclose who the creator of the game is, but in the case that the game 
						is publicly credited, all credits should go to Thomas Broughton and nobody else.
