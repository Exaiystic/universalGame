						Welcome to Military Clicker! The aim of the game is to build the biggest army
						possible by training soldiers. Soldiers can both be trained over time as
						well as be trained manually.
					</p><br>
					<p>
						At the start of the game, you can only train soldiers manually because you
						will not own any of the available upgrades. Only upgrades are able to
						automatically train soldiers over time. However, you need to use your trained
						soldiers in order to obtain these upgrades, which will put them out of
						action.

					<p>
						In order to manually train soldiers, you need to click the image of a soldier
						which will give you one trained soldier. As you can clearly see, this is not
						an efficient way to build an army.
					</p>
					<p>
						Upgrades are the best and most efficient way to train soldiers quickly.

					<p>
						Upgrades are "bought" with trained soldiers. Why? Because you need soldiers to
						build an obstacle course, a firing range, or even to censor the media. They
						are your staff, and so they will do as you tell them. But once they have done
						their job, they wont work for you any more.
					</p>
					<p>
						Upgrades that you can buy DO stack, however, the more of a single upgrade you buy,
						the more soldiers that will be needed in order for your upgrade to take place. 
						The best way to get more troops is to invade another country and take it's people
						for yourself. Of course, this will result in a lot of casualties within your army.
