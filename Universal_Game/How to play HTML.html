 What we are doing within these first few lines of code is setting up the document.
 The first thing that we are doing is stating the type of document that this file is,
 which is html, therefore, we state that the document type is html.

 Whilst opening the html tag, which is needed at the start of every html file, as well as to be
 closed at the end of every html file, we might as well set the language of the document,
 therefore the user's web browser will not have to automatically detect the language - as a web
 browser's function may not be accurate.

 The next set of lines are embedded within the head tag. The head tag is used for storing 'metadata', 
 which means data about data. In this case, I use the head tag as a container for storing external 
 css styling which I will be using throughout this web page, as well as adding two meta tags which are 
 needed for bootstrap to work - a third party framework which is also used throughout this document.
 
 I have also added my own style sheet, which can help keep my military theme consistent accross 
 multiple web pages. Lastly, the title has been set to 'How to play Military Clicker', which will be 
 displayed on the tab of the page.

 Everything within the body tag of the html document is part of the main section. The first few lines 
 that are within the body tag however are lines that import scripts from external libraries, such as 
 jQuery, Popper.js and Bootstrap.js.

 The navigation bar for the webpage. The navbar was made using the bootstrap 4 framework; bootstrap 4 is 
 a framework of CSS styled elements that have been given their own classes. 
 This allows for bootstrap users to call already-styled elements simply by stating an element class. 
		 
 The navbar itself is present on every webpage and can scale based on the browser resolution. 
 The navigation bar is a container for links that, when clicked on, take the user to another web page, 
 based on which link they have clicked on.

 The following segment is the main portion of the web page - it is where the main text of this page will 
 be. The text is styled by having it wrapped inside of a div with an appropriate id of 'wrapper'. With 
 the main content within this div, I can style the main content by simply styling the div, instead of 
 having to style every independent elements. Of course, in some places, it is simply better to style 
 independent elements.
 
 The first few lines set up both the wrapper div, as well as a div called 'container', which will act 
 as a place for storing elements that can be manipulated with bootstrap - which is most of these elements.
 
 The next lines create a header that will be at the top of the wrapper. The header tag has been given an 
 id so that the content can be externally styled to be made bold, as well as give the tag a different 
 background colour. The header tag is then closed so that no other element is unintentionally given the 
 same styling as the header itself.
 
 After the header is the section tag housing an article tag. The section tag make the main content that 
 will be within the div wrapper, whereas the article tag acts like a paragraph - a set of content that 
 is just part of the main page. The section tag has been given an id of 'mainSection' in order to indicate 
 that everything within this tag will be part of the main section. The id itself has styling attached to 
 it that basically helps space out the content around it, in order to make the web page look less 
 cluttered. Additionally, the article section has styling attached to it which makes the set content 
 within the tag look as if it was inside of a box - this was styled by giving the element a border, and a 
 different shade of green for a background.
 
 Each article is given it's own header (and consistently styled) in order to act as a subtitle. Of course, 
 the article also includes one or two paragraphs worth of content before the article tag is closed, and 
 another one is opened for more content.
 
 At the end of the section tag, there is a check box which the user will tick if he/she accept the terms 
 and conditions. Furthermore, before the end of the div, there is a footer. Despite the footer being 
 empty, it is kept there so that the space management of the div does not become misaligned.

						Welcome to Military Clicker! The aim of the game is to build the biggest army
						possible by training soldiers. Soldiers can both be trained over time as
						well as be trained manually.
					</p><br>
					<p>
						At the start of the game, you can only train soldiers manually because you
						will not own any of the available upgrades. Only upgrades are able to
						automatically train soldiers over time. However, you need to use your trained
						soldiers in order to obtain these upgrades, which will put them out of
						action.

						In order to manually train soldiers, you need to click the image of a soldier
						which will give you one trained soldier. As you can clearly see, this is not
						an efficient way to build an army.
					</p>
					<p>
						Upgrades are the best and most efficient way to train soldiers quickly.

					<p>
						Upgrades are "bought" with trained soldiers. Why? Because you need soldiers to
						build an obstacle course, a firing range, or even to censor the media. They
						are your staff, and so they will do as you tell them. But once they have done
						their job, they wont work for you any more.
					</p>
					<p>
						Upgrades that you can buy DO stack, however, the more of a single upgrade you buy,
						the more soldiers that will be needed in order for your upgrade to take place. 
						The best way to get more troops is to invade another country and take it's people
						for yourself. Of course, this will result in a lot of casualties within your army.
