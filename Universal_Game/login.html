 What we are doing within these first few lines of code is setting up the document.
 The first thing that we are doing is stating the type of document that this file is,
 which is html, therefore, we state that the document type is html.

 Whilst opening the html tag, which is needed at the start of every html file, as well as to be
 closed at the end of every html file, we might as well set the language of the document,
 therefore the user's web browser will not have to automatically detect the language - as a web
 browser's function may not be accurate.

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">

 The next set of lines are embedded within the head tag. The head tag is used for storing 'metadata', 
 which means data about data. In this case, I use the head tag as a container for storing external 
 css styling which I will be using throughout this web page, as well as adding two meta tags which are 
 needed for bootstrap to work - a third party framework which is also used throughout this document.
 
 I have also added my own style sheet, which can help keep my military theme consistent accross 
 multiple web pages. Lastly, the title has been set to 'Log into Military Clicker', which will be 
 displayed on the tab of the page.

The script, that is entered below, is used in order to store client-side processes and actions - known as 
JavaScript. When a function is called, the web browser will be looking within the script tag for a 
function with a matching name in order to execute it.

The first function, named togglePassword, is a function that is called when the user clicks the 'Toggle 
Password' button. The function's purpose is to toggle the password entry field's type from a password 
to a text based entry field, or the other way around. What this ultimately does is either display what
the entered value is, or to hide it. This is done by getting the meta data (data about data) of the 
input field, and storing it in a variable - a storage box that can be overwritten and refreshed upon the 
web page being reloaded. The variable, with the meta data stored within it, can then be ran through a 
conditional statement saying that: "if the field type is set to 'password', then the type should be 
changed to 'text'". This also goes for the other way around - if the field type is set to 'text', the 
function should change the type to 'password'.

The next function is called loginNotify. The function has two purposes: to verify that the username and 
password fields have been filled in, and to notify the user that they have been successfully logged in 
by displaying their user name within a message. The function works by storing the input data from both 
the login entry field, and the password entry field in two variables (one for the user name and one for 
the password). After the input values have been stored, the script runs a conditional statement that 
states that if the length of both the user name and password variables are smaller than one, the web 
browser will tell the user to enter both a user name and password, as well as to leave the page as it is, 
meaning that the page will not refresh like it normally does when being submitted. However, the 
conditional statement says that if the user name and password both have a length of at least one, the 
web browser will say that the user was successfully logged in, as well as refresh the page, like what 
would normally happen when pressing a submit button.

	<script>
		<!-- Toggle showing password within the log in form -->
		function togglePassword() {
			var pass = document.getElementById("passwordField");
			if (pass.type === "password") {
				pass.type = "text";
			} else {
				pass.type = "password";
			}
		}
		
		<!-- When logging in, the page will display a message using the user's details -->
		function loginNotify() {
			var username = document.getElementById("usernameField").value;
			var password = document.getElementById("passwordField").value;
			if (username.length < 1 || password.length < 1){
				alert("Please enter both a username and a password.");
				return false;
			} else {
				alert(username + " successfully logged in.");
				return true;
			}
		}

 Everything within the body tag of the html document is part of the main section. The first few lines 
 that are within the body tag however are lines that import scripts from external libraries, such as 
 jQuery, Popper.js and Bootstrap.js.

 The navigation bar for the webpage. The navbar was made using the bootstrap 4 framework; bootstrap 4 is 
 a framework of CSS styled elements that have been given their own classes. 
 This allows for bootstrap users to call already-styled elements simply by stating an element class. 
		 
 The navbar itself is present on every webpage and can scale based on the browser resolution. 
 The navigation bar is a container for links that, when clicked on, take the user to another web page, 
 based on which link they have clicked on.

 The following segment is the main portion of the web page - it is where the main text of this page will 
 be. The text is styled by having it wrapped inside of a div with an appropriate id of 'wrapper'. With 
 the main content within this div, I can style the main content by simply styling the div, instead of 
 having to style every independent elements. Of course, in some places, it is simply better to style 
 independent elements.
 
 The first few lines set up both the wrapper div, as well as a div called 'container', which will act 
 as a place for storing elements that can be manipulated with bootstrap - which is most of these elements.
 
 The next lines create a header that will be at the top of the wrapper. The header tag has been given an 
 id so that the content can be externally styled to be made bold, as well as give the tag a different 
 background colour. The header tag is then closed so that no other element is unintentionally given the 
 same styling as the header itself.
 
 After the header is the section tag housing an article tag. The section tag make the main content that 
 will be within the div wrapper, whereas the article tag acts like a paragraph - a set of content that 
 is just part of the main page. The section tag has been given an id of 'mainSection' in order to indicate 
 that everything within this tag will be part of the main section. The id itself has styling attached to 
 it that basically helps space out the content around it, in order to make the web page look less 
 cluttered. Additionally, the article section has styling attached to it which makes the set content 
 within the tag look as if it was inside of a box - this was styled by giving the element a border, and a 
 different shade of green for a background.
 
 Each article is given it's own header (and consistently styled) in order to act as a subtitle. Of course, 
 the article also includes one or two paragraphs worth of content before the article tag is closed, and 
 another one is opened for more content.
 
 The article tag also house the form which contains the entry field for both the user's user name and 
 password. Additionally, there is a button that is embedded within the password entry field that calls the 
 togglePassword function from the script tag at the top of the file. At the bottom of the form is a submit 
 button which will call the loginNotify function when it is clicked. 
 
 At the end of the section tag, there is a check box which the user will tick if he/she accept the terms 
 and conditions. Furthermore, before the end of the div, there is a footer. Despite the footer being 
 empty, it is kept there so that the space management of the div does not become misaligned.
