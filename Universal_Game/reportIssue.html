 What we are doing within these first few lines of code is setting up the document.
 The first thing that we are doing is stating the type of document that this file is,
 which is html, therefore, we state that the document type is html.

 Whilst opening the html tag, which is needed at the start of every html file, as well as to be
 closed at the end of every html file, we might as well set the language of the document,
 therefore the user's web browser will not have to automatically detect the language - as a web
 browser's function may not be accurate.

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">

 The next set of lines are embedded within the head tag. The head tag is used for storing 'metadata', 
 which means data about data. In this case, I use the head tag as a container for storing external 
 css styling which I will be using throughout this web page, as well as adding two meta tags which are 
 needed for bootstrap to work - a third party framework which is also used throughout this document.
 
 I have also added my own style sheet, which can help keep my military theme consistent accross 
 multiple web pages. Lastly, the title has been set to 'Report an Issue', which will be 
 displayed on the tab of the page.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------->

The script, that is entered below, is used in order to store client-side processes and actions - known as 
JavaScript. When a function is called, the web browser will be looking within the script tag for a 
function with a matching name in order to execute it.

The first function, called 'deviceChange' is used in order to change the answer of the first drop down 
menu to 'other' in the case that a user attempts to enter something in the text entry field for an unlisted
device. This is done by simply triggering the function when the user enters a key within the field and 
then switching the value to other.

The function 'browserChange' does pretty much the exact same as deviceChange, but for the question asking 
about what browser the user is using.

The third function 'problemAdd' checks the box stating that the problem is located in an unlisted area 
when the user typed something into the field used for specifying where the problem is. The overall function 
is similar to the previous two, but using a checkbox instead of a drop down box.

The next two functions 'deviceRemoveOther' and 'browserRemoveOther' are in a way the opposite to the first 
two functions - when a user enters something within the fields that specify what device/browser they are 
using, but then change the drop down answer from 'other', the field's contents will automatically be 
removed.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------->
	
	<script>
		function deviceChange() {
			document.getElementById("deviceDrop").value="other";
		}
	
		function browserChange() {
			document.getElementById("browserDrop").value="other";
		}
	
		function problemAdd() {
			document.getElementById("otherCheck").checked="true";
		}
		
		function deviceRemoveOther() {
			document.getElementById("deviceOther").value=" ";
		}
		
		function browserRemoveOther() {
			document.getElementById("browserOther").value=" ";
		}
	</script>

 Everything within the body tag of the html document is part of the main section. The first few lines 
 that are within the body tag however are lines that import scripts from external libraries, such as 
 jQuery, Popper.js and Bootstrap.js.

 The navigation bar for the webpage. The navbar was made using the bootstrap 4 framework; bootstrap 4 is 
 a framework of CSS styled elements that have been given their own classes. 
 This allows for bootstrap users to call already-styled elements simply by stating an element class. 
		 
 The navbar itself is present on every webpage and can scale based on the browser resolution. 
 The navigation bar is a container for links that, when clicked on, take the user to another web page, 
 based on which link they have clicked on.

 The following segment is the main portion of the web page - it is where the main text of this page will 
 be. The text is styled by having it wrapped inside of a div with an appropriate id of 'wrapper'. With 
 the main content within this div, I can style the main content by simply styling the div, instead of 
 having to style every independent elements. Of course, in some places, it is simply better to style 
 independent elements.
 
 The first few lines set up both the wrapper div, as well as a div called 'container', which will act 
 as a place for storing elements that can be manipulated with bootstrap - which is most of these elements.
 
 The next lines create a header that will be at the top of the wrapper. The header tag has been given an 
 id so that the content can be externally styled to be made bold, as well as give the tag a different 
 background colour. The header tag is then closed so that no other element is unintentionally given the 
 same styling as the header itself.
 
 After the header is the section tag housing an article tag. The section tag makes the main content that 
 will be within the div wrapper, whereas the article tag acts like a paragraph - a set of content that 
 is just part of the main page. The section tag has been given an id of 'mainSection' in order to indicate 
 that everything within this tag will be part of the main section. The id itself has styling attached to 
 it that basically helps space out the content around it, in order to make the web page look less 
 cluttered. Additionally, the article section has styling attached to it which makes the set content 
 within the tag look as if it was inside of a box - this was styled by giving the element a border, and a 
 different shade of green for a background.
 
 Within the article tag, there is a form, which allows the user to input data to the web browser, whether 
 that be through a text entry field, a drop down box, or a check box/radio button. This is used to find out 
 what device, browser and element the problem was found in, as well as what the problem actually is. After 
 the user has inputted all of the data, they can click on a submit button that will send this data, when 
 connected to a PHP server, to the host server which can then have the data be analysed.
